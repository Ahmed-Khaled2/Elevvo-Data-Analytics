## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This task explores the classic **Titanic** dataset.  
The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights into passenger survival patterns.

The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Summary statistics and group-based insights
- Visualizing key patterns and correlations

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset & Format
- **Source:** [Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- **Format:** `.csv`

---

## ðŸ“Š Covered Topics
- **EDA:**
  - Inspecting data types & handling missing values
  - Handling duplicates & nulls
  - Converting data types for consistency
  - Analysing Outliers
- **Data Visualization:**
  - Survival rates by gender and passenger class
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis
  - Bar plots for group comparisons
  - Fare Distribution by Pclass
  - and more...

---

## ðŸš€ Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Checked for missing values
   - Filled or removed missing entries
   - Converted data types (e.g., date columns, categorical encoding)
2. **Summary Statistics:**
   - Calculated central tendencies & distributions
   - Group-based insights (e.g., survival by gender & class)
3. **Visualizations:**
   - Bar plots of survival rates by gender and class
   - Heatmaps to display survival rates across multiple categories

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Bonus
- Created a **heatmap** showing survival rates by passenger class and gender.
- Added **bar plots** comparing survival rates across different groups.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Example Insights
- **Females** had a much higher survival rate than **males**.
- First and second-class passengers survived at higher rates than third-class.
- Among females, survival rate was ~95% in first/second class, but dropped to ~50% in third class.
