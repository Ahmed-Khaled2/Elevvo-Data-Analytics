## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This task focuses on **Customer Segmentation** using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model**.  
By analyzing customer behavior, we group customers into meaningful segments and to help suggest simple marketing strategies.

The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Summary statistics and group-based insights
- Visualizing key patterns and correlations

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset & Format
- **Source:** [Online Retail Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)  
- **Format:** `.csv`

## ðŸ”Ž RFM Explained  
- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frequency (F):** How often a customer purchased  
- **Monetary (M):** How much money a customer spent

Each customer is scored on R, F, and M â†’ combined into **RFM Segments**.
